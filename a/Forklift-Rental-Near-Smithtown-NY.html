<p>Specifically engineered for the unique challenges of a narrow-aisle warehouse environment, the Crown RR 5700 features the industry's first traction control system, enhanced execution of load-handling functions, and the fastest lift and travel speeds among other available reach trucks. The aim of this course is to provide delegates with the knowledge and practical skills needed to safely operate an Industrial Masted Lift Truck. Whether a forklift will safely carry a load or will tip forward can be determined by comparing the moment (a tendency to produce motion) of both the load and the forklift. Our rental fleet stands ready to supply you with immediate equipment when a need arises.</p>
<p>Lift Capacity: 12000 lbs. The Raymond 5000 Series order pickers deliver exceptional versatility, intuitive handling and easy maintenance. Experience proves that operators who are properly trained, keep within the forklift's load capacity, and follow rules of safe operation avoid tipovers and accidents. Forklift training has many names, such as forklift licensing or forklift certification.</p>

The 2C5000 became the primary model in 2010 and had maintained its status as one of the premier forklift models ever since.</p>

Ask your Raymond Handling Concepts Sales Rep about new, used or rental availability of lift trucks and other materials handling equipment.</p>

This Construction Plant Competence Scheme (CPCS) training course is aimed at those who operate a Rough Terrain Forklift in a construction environment and have successfully completed the CSCS Health, Safety and Environment touchscreen test for Operatives within the past two years. The forklift manufacturer makes valves and hose routing accessories, but the parts and labor to install can be prohibitively expensive.</p>

Backed with a team of professional and experts of the industry, we are involved in offering Roll Pallet Truck. We also rent out electric forklift batteries and battery chargers to eliminate your forklift downtime.

<p>The forks on a reach truck are attached to a pantograph mechanism that extends them forward to place in or retrieve pallets from warehouse racking. Order pickers feature an elevating platform that brings the operator to the level of the stock, similar to a cherry picker. The extra-long frame combined with a larger counterweight means this model can handle larger loads.</p>
