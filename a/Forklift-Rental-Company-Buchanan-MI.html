The car loan experts at our San Diego lease department will make absolutely sure you have the very best rates on any Chevrolet lifted truck. Using the procedure outlined for these tests, a truck shall not overturn when the platform upon which the truck is standing is tilted to a 6 percent slope for loaded truck (Test #N3), or an 8 percent slope for unloaded truck (Test #N3A).</p>

<h2>Truck With A Lift Buchanan</h2>
<p>Capable of lifting 20,000 pounds, this is the latest of Load Lifter's high-visibility forklifts. The following tests are designed to verify rated capacities of Narrow-Aisle-Rider fork trucks having rated capacities up to and including 10,000 lb at 24-inch load center and to determine capacity or alternate rated capacities. If other tests or tests for trucks over 10,000 lb rated capacity are required, the details should be agreed upon between the interested parries.</p>
