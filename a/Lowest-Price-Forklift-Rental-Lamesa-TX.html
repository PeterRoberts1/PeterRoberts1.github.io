<p>Some electric forklift batteries require chargers that must be hard wired and may require a professional for installation. Drivers will also appreciate the better view of the roads in Brownwood, which comes in handy in avoiding obstacles during off-roading journeys. Trucks may be of the reaching or non-reaching type, equipped with tilting mast, or forks that tilt alone without tilting mast, or without any form of mast or fork tilt.</p>
<p>The result is simple: once the already-huge truck is lifted to an even huger height, it goes from "somewhat unsafe" to "incredibly scary." Not for the people in the truck, mind you. Whether you're venturing off the beaten path or commuting to work, the higher seating position makes it easier to see further down the road and over other vehicles. If the loads are too much for the load capacity of the truck, this can cause the lift to tip over.</p>
