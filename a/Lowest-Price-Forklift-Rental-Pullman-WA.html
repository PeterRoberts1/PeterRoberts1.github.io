Always wear gloves when handling pallets. A part of the warranty, we include maintenance kits with the machines, so you can forget about additional costs when you receive your Bomaq forklift.</p>
<p>The forklift is every bit as good as they said it would be. I highly recommend this company.

ICE forklifts can be powered by gasoline, diesel, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). When handling off-center loads which cannot be centered, operate with caution.
