We're always out looking for a great deal on a pre-owned forklift, so that we can be the main source you look to when you are wanting to purchase one.

Although trucks are rated at 24 inches load center, the load center for Test #N3 should be either 24 or 16 inches - whichever would produce the less stable condition.</p>
