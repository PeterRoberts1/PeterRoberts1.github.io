This Motorised pallet truck is used in several industries for lifting purposes and due to its long functional life. However, the deaths of nearly 100 workers and 20,000 serious injuries that occur each year show that a forklift can be dangerous. Many advantages exist for using reach trucks.

<p>Also, this rental service is available to us in many types at pocket-friendly rates. To operate an order-picking forklift truck you need an LO high risk work licence. Since washing a lifted truck also involves washing tires (and pretty massive ones sometimes), I would recommend using a handheld tire brush like the one pictured above for rubber sidewalls. There are different models of forklifts, and there are various forklift features that might not be the same with every model.</p>
