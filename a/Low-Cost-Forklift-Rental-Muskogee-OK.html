Choose machine category (petrol forklift, diesel, telescopic etc.), location, price range, manufacturer, production year and the seller, you want to buy the forklift from. Though moving away from the traditional LPG and diesel powered forklift is a major decision, electrics are associated with many advantages.</p>
<p>Do not alter or eliminate any forklift parts or add any forklift parts or add any accessories such as additional counterweight or lifting attachments unless approved by the manufacturer in writing. Longitudinal stability isn't the only concern for lift truck operators.
