<p>This German company is arguably the best material handling organization in Europe. Masts with two, three, or even four sections allow choosing a lift height best suited to particular operations, and the free-lift feature offered on some masts (allowing the forks to raise without extending the mast) makes working in low-overhead situations much easier.

<p>With Crown's Stability Stance, operators have four points of solid contact with the lift truck when stopping and starting from 9 metres in the air. Like a rental car, if you were to need insurance coverage, then this could be another $50 to $150+ per day and would only cover the truck. This is because the forks are mounted to the side of the truck and can pick up wide or long loads that would be awkward or inaccessible with a straight forward forklift.</p>
