Industrial counterbalance lift trucks are deadly - more than one hundred workers die and thousands are injured every year as a result of these powerful machines.

With excellent machine and load stability due to an optimum centre of gravity and suspension provided by large diameter tyres, these machines provide high mobility and great productivity in rough terrain environments. It is rumored that electric forklifts are maintenance free due to less moving parts and their cleaner environments.</p>
<p>We also operate three trucks for parts collection in Johannesburg and share the use of a warehouse facility in Jet Park for these conditions.
