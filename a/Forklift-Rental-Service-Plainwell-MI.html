It is also not a substitute for a powered industrial truck operator training program. These calculations take into account variations in design including tire, mast, and other deflections, and provide a means for predicting with reasonable accuracy the stability of fork trucks. The second hand forklifts, offered by us, for buying and selling purposes are in fine working condition and thus, require minimum maintenance.</p>
<p>To obtain a forklift licence in any State or Territory an applicant must undertake a training course with an approved training organisation and then, on completion of the course, apply to the appropriate State or Territory for a forklift licence.

Ask your Raymond Handling Concepts Sales Rep about new, used or rental availability of order pickers.</p>
