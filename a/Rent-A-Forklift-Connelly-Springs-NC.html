<p>Some order pickers actually load their pallets into trucks. Drivers in lifted trucks need to be especially vigilant for anybody entering or exiting their blind spots. It gets a lot more complicated when we add the weight of a load to the forklift, and raise that load in the air. When the first mast reaches maximum height, the second mast will extend. If you are lacking capital to purchase a forklift, or fleet of forklifts, we have flexible financing options available to help you secure the equipment that you need now.</p>

<p>Truck drivers in the Houston area won't believe the lifted trucks and 4x4 conversion trucks on sale right now at Turner Chevrolet in Crosby. These lift trucks work in a narrower aisle than mid-level order pickers and are wire or rail guided.

<p>A lifted truck, often referred to as a 4x4 truck, is a modified vehicle specially designed for off road driving and other types of high-impact work.

<p>Raymond 4000 Series sit down forklifts provide the visibility needed to maximize operator confidence, and minimize damage to racks, products, and facilities. It's the grandchild of the C5000 series, one of the most beloved forklifts ever made. Not all forklifts work the same, and many come equipped with different features. These forklifts can drive under 8 foot passages, and come in two-wheel, four-wheel, and four-wheel crab steering (all wheels are able to turn).</p>
<p>Forklifts are designed and manufactured deliberately unbalanced. Typically the billing cycle for a forklift rental is monthly, but daily billing or weekly billing is available depending on the rental period and requirements of the renter. Essentially two branches of the same tree, narrow aisle and very narrow aisle forklifts are further enhanced through swing mast and turret truck operation.</p>
