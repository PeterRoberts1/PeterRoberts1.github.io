<p>Proper load balancing is imperative to driving a forklift safely. For indoor use on smooth surfaces, with similar ground clearance to cushion tire forklift. Quality parts for all lift trucks and all lift truck needs. We carry both electric and internal combustion forklifts, with capacities from 5,000 to 40,000 pounds and lifts with cushion or pneumatic tires. The test load shall be equivalent to an unrestrained homogeneous cube, the dimensions of which are twice the rated load center dimension and the weight of which is equal to the rated capacity load of the truck.</p>
<p>Virtually any standard sized truck can be lifted to a certain extent or another. Some pallet jack models are able to lift loads all the way up to 15,000 pounds (6,803 kg). The forklift and load must be considered a unit with a continually varying center of gravity with every movement of the load. The pallet truck is simply for moving loads from one place to another at ground level, but it has limited reach, while the lift truck is more complex and is capable of transporting and lifting a palletised load onto a higher level or for stacking loads on top of each other.</p>
