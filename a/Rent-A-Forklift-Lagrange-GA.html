<p>Debating whether to rent versus buy a forklift or other material handling equipment? Pallet jacks come in a several types , including manual kinds, as well as electric-powered units, but the basic design is always the same: Two forks are positioned horizontal to the floor, allowing the operator to slide the jack under a pallet.

<p>Most RT forklifts available in the North American market use Tier 4-Final engines, and many of these engines are rated at 74 horsepower, such as the 4.4-liter JCB EcoMax engine used in the company's model 950 RT forklift.
