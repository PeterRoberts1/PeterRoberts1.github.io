In other cases, you may find that there are fellow lifted truck enthusiasts in the area who can provide you with additional information.</p>

Such vehicles activate the suspension lift while traversing road bumps and ramps to avoid damaging the front underbody of the vehicle when driving on public roads; the suspension lift is deactivated on race tracks and level roads.</p>
