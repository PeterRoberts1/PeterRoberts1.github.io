<p>Rough terrain forklifts, also known as all-terrain forklifts, are designed to work in construction sites and other areas without improved surfaces (soft ground, muddy ground, hills, ditches, etc.).

We can help your business identify your unique needs and help narrow your search for the right forklift or equipment to fit those needs, all while keeping you within your budget. Moving mast reach forklifts have a higher ground clearance due to larger wheels, but are unable to handle double deep racking responsibilities without a fork extension attachment.</p>
<p>Also, the higher you go with a twist, the less down travel you will have, causing quirky handling, such as skipping across the road imperfections, rather that soaking them up. On 4x4 vehicles, this also causes an issue because you could over-extend a CV axle joint on a truck that has excessive compression, but limited droop. They handle different sizes of loads and are engineered to perfection.</p>
