<p>Rough-terrain forklifts with telescopic booms are a unique category offering longer horizontal reach, and some models can swivel a full 360 degrees for improved maneuverability. While some may know forklifts primarily as a material handling appliance, there are in fact many different categories of forklifts. As the fork lift trucks are usually quite expensive, many industry enterprises choose to buy used forklifts on industrial auctions, which reduces the cost of the process they implement.</p>
