<p>They can weather any environment and derive fuel from multiple sources, but they do not have the unique capacities that reach forklifts do.

This training is for workers who operate an industrial lift truck (classes 1, 4 or 5) in the workplace, commonly known as counterbalance forklift”.</p>
<p>This type of forklift makes use of pneumatic or air-filled tires, as opposed to counterbalance forklifts which use cushion tires. Control pedals and control platforms stood on or engaged by the operator's feet should have non-skid surfaces.
