<p>The M series is the first generation forklifts, designed by the MAXIMAL engineering team. The China Pallet Trucks market holds a major value share in the global market and is likely maintain its dominance in the global Pallet Trucks market over the forecast period. We offer forklift sales and rentals that include everything from pallet stackers to reach trucks. As forklift operators need to sit in their machine for hours together, a high-quality adjustable seat is essential.</p>
<p>The low step-in height, easy trailer connection and simple battery change make these trucks very user-friendly. For example, a sit-down, counterbalanced high-lift rider truck is more likely than a motorized hand truck to be involved in a falling load accident because the sit-down rider truck can lift a load much higher than a hand truck. The Universal Stance Reach-Fork Truck allows the operator to look comfortably straight up while storing and retrieving loads.</p>

<p>The primary difference between class 5 models of class 4 are the tires each IC forklift equip. Alternate capacities may be established at the same specified load center and at less than maximum elevation of the load engaging means. Detrich says that such features as the clear-view” mast (with lift cylinders on the outside of the mast to provide an unhindered view to the forks), shorter turning radii, hydraulic side-shift of carriage and forks, and improved ergonomic operator platforms result in machines that provide operators with greater control, convenience, and comfort.</p>

Skilled forklift operators annually compete in obstacle and timed challenges at regional forklift rodeos.</p>

Standard forklifts generally measure between 4 to 7 ft wide and 8 to 10 ft long. Knowing your required lift height is equally important and will affect your unit's load-carrying capacity.</p>
