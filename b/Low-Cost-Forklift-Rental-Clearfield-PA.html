<p>Each type of powered industrial truck presents different operating hazards. According to the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health ( NIOSH ), the three most common types of forklift injuries happen when: 1) A forklift rolls or overturns. For those who do a lot of off-roading, a taller stance adds extra ground clearance, and allows for bigger wheels and tires.</p>

Like the base model 3-wheel forklift, the basic 4-wheel capacity is 3,000 lb. But the difference between the two types of trucks is that 4-wheels don't quite have the maneuverability of 3-wheels.</p>
<p>Even among lift kits, there are smaller options that just level out the truck from the common nose down” factory settings and others that will make your truck tall enough to walk under. Browse Order Picker Truck Equipment. The Mast is capable of rotating 90 degrees, and the forks can then advance like on a reach mechanism, to pick full pallets weighing 3,000 - 6,000lbs.</p>
