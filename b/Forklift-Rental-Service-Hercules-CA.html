These low-reach forklifts are suitable for double floor stacking and low-level racking and shelving operations. For its loading capacity, it could deal with materials of up to 3300 lbs.</p>
<p>Wang says that Hangcha will continue to invest in rough-terrain R&D, particularly in developing equipment with more tonnage and configurations. Rough terrain poses additional threats and risks to the operators of forklifts. However, suspension lift kits let the truck owners lift their truck as high as they want.
