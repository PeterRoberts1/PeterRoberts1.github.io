<p>With greater ground clearance, a counterbalance forklift is certainly the better choice for uneven surface or outside work. Industrial counterbalance lift trucks are deadly - more than one hundred workers die and thousands are injured every year as a result of these powerful machines. Rough-terrain forklifts offer great versatility and are often called to fill a niche application.</p>
<p>That's why it's so important for operators to complete FLT counterbalance license training and receive their forklift operator certification. Many models of rough terrain forklifts are also 4-wheel drive; also available in 2-wheel. Electric forklift batteries last 6 consecutive hours or throughout an 8-hour shift with 2-3 breaks.

<p>That is the principle upon which every detail of the design of these order pickers is based: The low entry height is gentle on the legs when mounting and dismounting, platforms with non-slip mats that are decoupled from the chassis by rubber supports reduce the effect of vibrations, and operation is simple thanks to ergonomically arranged and shaped control panels.</p>

<p>Using the procedure outlined for the test, an empty truck with the forks elevated to any height up to the maximum height at which horizontal travel is permitted, and for the travel speed allowable at that height, should not overturn when the test platform, and for the travel speed allowable at that height, should not overturn when the test platform upon which the truck is standing is tilted to the slope specified by Graph D, Curve 1, for unrestricted turning and by Graph D, Curve 2, for straight forward and reverse travel, travel, no turning ± 10 degrees.</p>
<p>Even if repairs are necessary, a used forklift is cheaper to fix as the parts are less costly.
