<p>1. Counterbalance - Counterbalance forklifts are the most common trucks used in virtually all material handling capacities. An electric pallet jack. In keeping with design advances in many other types of electronic technology, a number of RT forklift models are available with telematics systems, such as JCB's Livelink and Case's SiteWatch.

<p>While excellent for indoor use, reach trucks for not suitable for outdoor work due to their under-carriage clearance. Many rough terrain forklifts can also handle work platforms.

<p>The second type of lift kit is the suspension lift kit. The average pallet jack can lift about 5,000 pounds (2,268 kg).
