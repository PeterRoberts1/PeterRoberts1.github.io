Layman's Terms: Off-roading is fun, until you have to be towed 30 miles to a shop when your driveshaft falls out because you just had to have the huge lift. If you lift a load too high, you can cause the forklift to tip over. As time has passed, forklifts have tended to specialization.</p>
<p>Sit-down forklifts are also more accessible to a wider pool of forklift operators for that reason. Some of these can also save you on the purchase of unnecessary equipment by converting a rough terrain forklift to a number of other heavy industrial machines. Lift Capacity: 6000 lbs. First, forklifts can be classified according to the type of engine. Renting a forklift requires almost as much forethought as buying one.</p>
