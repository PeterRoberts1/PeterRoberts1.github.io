<p>When standard pallet sizes launched in 1930, forklifts became even more useful.

Affordability - Rental forklift is highly affordable; you can rent a high-capacity forklift at a very reasonable cost.</p>

Forklifts were first invented during early part of the 20th century and now had become a vital part of the modern-day industrial world.

<p>Forklift Trucks have a significant and higher share across the food and beverage industry. For trucks with tilting masts, the mast should be vertical as defined in Test OP1, or at full rearward tilt, whichever is less stable.
