<h2>Electric Pallet Truck King</h2>
<p>All personnel required to operate a Industrial Counterbalance Forklift Truck should complete this training and testing. It is also backed with priority support from our nationwide team of field service forklift technicians. While it can't reach difficult angles the way that a telehandler can, it is capable of lifting payloads much higher off the ground than a warehouse forklift and heavier loads.</p>

In the process of training I was trained to work the controls and the capacity of the weight of the mass. Whether you need a short-term forklift rental when equipment is down for repair or you need to expand your forklift fleet for the busy season, Select Equipment's friendly staff is here to help.</p>
<p>While most know forklifts the main function of material handling, in fact, there are many different categories of these.

You shouldn't ever buy forklifts that haven't had a Thorough Examinations test done, and you shouldn't purchase from a forklift sales dealer who doesn't know the ins and outs of lifting equipment. Most standard forklifts can reach heights between 10 and 15 ft, but special forklifts like the telehandler can lift as high as 55 ft depending on the telehandler size you select.</p>
